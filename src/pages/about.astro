		<p>
			i began jotting notes and keeping a record of my day-to-day (week-to-week in lazier times lol). it was a 
			great practice but what i missed was the digital component. before having a notebook, all of my ideas, sketches, quotes, and notes were scattered across various
			apps which grew tiresome to maintain. i tried notion and apps like it, and while it almost itched that part of my brain, something was still missing. anywho, 
			decided it might before to do that collection here.
