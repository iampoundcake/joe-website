it pats the cheek, but def almost left a mark.

## more thoughts (spoilers)

as far as romantasies go, this one is pretty good. enemies-to-lovers. the tension there was decent. it is not genre-bending by any means but definitely a good entry into the lexicon of romantasies. i think if you love this genre, then you will enjoy this book. there are def moments that catch you off guard with how emotionally dense it is. i found myself surprised at how attached i grew toward certain characters. i think it's worth the read if you're looking for something fun and entertaining to read.
