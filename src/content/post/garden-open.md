## why a garden or wiki?

the origin of this site had less to do with a blog and more to do with having a holding place for the dumb and/or irrelevant and/or fascinating and/or poignant and/or funny things i happen to research. i have a tendency to hyperfocus. i talk a little about this in the [about](/about/) section.

when something captures my interest, i obsess over it. and even though, eventually, the shine dulls, i always take something away that somehow comes back around later. the worst part is when it comes back around later and i can't quite put my mind on what exactly it was or where i heard it.

enter the commonplace (note)book. i started one a few years ago, but i can't escape the fact that much of my life and leisure has been spent on a computer. so, this felt more natural to me. and while i like notion, it ultimately became distracting to use. 

## sure... but really. y tho?

my friends and i were talking about how crazy it is that there's so much about our own parents we don't know. i think a lot about loved ones who have passed and how much i don't know. the things they really cared about. the stuff that made them sad. made them burn. made them wonder. and even though no notebook or site can capture everything about a person, it's my way of leaving a digital structure behind. a relic if you will.

## what is a commonplace book

there's a ton out there on this very topic so i'll keep it brief. i imagine a commonplace book to be similar to leonardo da vinci's journals. there was science, notes, ramblings about things he observed, sketches (obviously), among other things. admittedly, i am by no means da vinci, but it's nice to park whatever madness is racing in our heads from time to time.

## make your own

  - he also has some great videos about philosophy

## check it out

far i have added some thoughts around [health & wellness](/garden/health/). i plan to add some more soon regarding:
- philosophy
- space 
- house and diy
- gaming
- world religions
- sketches/creative work
- whatever else 

## in conclusion

thanks for reading. hopefully, this encourages anyone to start their own analog or digital commonplace.
