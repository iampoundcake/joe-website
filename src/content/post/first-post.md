## hi

this first post is a bit of an explainer, but also a test run of the md.

with any luck, this site will be the equivalent of an old car i can tinker with.[^1] 

## a catch all

this site will operate as a centralized hubs for things most people will probably not care for, but excited to commit things in my head to something more tangible. whether it be a business idea that will go nowhere, or a thought on a new philosophical principle i learned, i don't have to think about where to put it anymore. 

## ongoing projects

it will also be a nice place to track my ongoing projects as well. with the baby coming, and a new house (ðŸ¤¯)[^2], there will be no shortage of projects. things i'm already considering in no priority or order:

### house
- nursery ðŸ‘¶
- router and access points
- bathroom vanity
- car shopping[^3]
- home gym setup[^4]

### personal
- this site (âœ…)
  - a place to practice web dev
- build photography page
- making some type of tangible object[^5]
- 40 books by the end of the year
- get back to jogging

## that's it for now...
like all things, this will just build upon iteration, upon iteration, upon iteration. until the next log...

[^1]: to be honest, i'll probably have an irl car to tinker with, too... but too many projects never hurt anyone...

[^2]: katie and i found out we were pregnant at the end of last year, cascading into an obvious, but appropriately crazy set of events.

[^3]: current car is too small for car seats and the like... for later --> how long should i keep this car as a beater? ðŸ¤”

[^4]: nothing fancy for now. to develop a list.
[^5]: i watch too many videos on 3D printing and polymer clay to _not_ make something
