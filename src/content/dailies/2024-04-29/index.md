_This post is a retrospective on 4/30._

## hours of sleep

6.5

## poi (points of interest)

- i loved waking up with katie thinking about this moment. it felt like christmas.
- closing day. what a day. probably one of the most surreal moments is realizing you own a home.
- one part hype. one part scared. one part... disbelief? like who let us do this? lol
- but also immense pride... i'm so proud of katie and i.
- the sellers were wonderful and so accommodating. we got lucky for sure.
- they had a mini plaque on the door [céad míle fáilte](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/c%C3%A9ad_m%C3%ADle_f%C3%A1ilte)

## song stuck in my head

## gratitude

- we have a home. a home to ourselves. i don't know that i cared that much about owning a home growing up. but since monday, i couldn't get over the idea that this house ... whole house was truly _ours_. i rolled the words "our home" in my mind over and over again. it's an amazing feeling.
- to have a wonderful home our child will grow in. that we will have a place at all.
- thankful for so many of our friends that shared their perspectives and stories about moving
- aunt colleen has been a literal saint throughout this moving process
- our family's support and love throughout this pregnancy and house hunting
- i love how green and tree filled the neighborhood is
- i could go on, but i'll save it for other dailies.
