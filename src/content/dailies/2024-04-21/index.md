## poi (points of interest)

- sometimes if i don't know what i'm feeling, it's better to pause.
- fixing the immediate problem may require a little time away.
- financial planning session with katie
- made all-day sunday sauce.
- finally updated the site and with the help of [yosmanprogrammer](https://github.com/YosmanProgrammer), got the new collections working.
- yesterday - golfed, did well for my first time out compared to years past. bombed a drive for 314 yards - my longest drive during a round! - test drove a used subaru outback onyx xt, and used lexus nx300 ... i think i preferred the outback? but i'm not sure if i'm biased. hoping to test drive the acura rdx this week.

## song stuck in my head

## gratitude

- i'm still filled with so much joy thinking about building a home with katie and welcoming our baby boy to our family. it's surreal, incredible, scary, emotional, but wonderful all at the same time. i feel lucky to be on this ride.
- i'm excited about our new home. i don't know that i ever, in my life, imagined that i'd own a home in the suburb of new york city. as a kid, i always loved the idea of being in the big apple, but didn't believe that would actually happen and if it did, i'd be a broke artist, struggling for his big break on broadway.
