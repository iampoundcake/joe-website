_This post is a retrospective._

## hours of sleep

7.4

## poi (points of interest)

- was feeling unmotivated and wondered what was going on and remembered that the night before, I had drank AND didnâ€™t really adhere to any of my habits lol so, it makes sense.
- the disparity between things that should get done, and things i can will myself to can feel so wide
- therapy thoughts: relationships are always a work in progress. itâ€™s part of the process. assuming one can fix a relationship for good is to believe in a false promise.
- therapy thoughts pt. 2: youâ€™ll never fully conquer your natural blind spots. but much like a blind spot, over time you will gather the sixth sense that something _may_ approach that blind spot, and having the awareness to know when it passes.

## song stuck in my head

canâ€™t remember

## gratitude

- i remembered thinking how happy iâ€™d be once we were done with closing because it would alleviate the low hum of anxiety
- having a clean home. itâ€™s a nice blank slate before the chaos of our move hits.

#### comments

- after going in mon - thur, on thur night i just break out of my disciplined shell lol, sort of like a cheat day, but for habits/discipline.. not always, necessarily in a food way. not sure what that is. however, i do acknowledge that it perpetuates a cycle of mon-thur is structured, balanced, disciplined, then fri and sat are like free-for-alls. finally, on sunday, iâ€™ll come out of that hole readying myself for Monday.
- this might be pretty normal, but i still feel guilty about it? itâ€™s the weekend for a reason lol but i canâ€™t shake the feeling that this cycle is not the best but i donâ€™t know where that judgment comes from ðŸ¤”
