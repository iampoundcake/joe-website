This might have done better with 10 episodes, or maybe pace the show so that episode 5 is episode 8, making season 1 more like part 1 of the first book.\r\n\r\nHowever, again, the netflix formula has its constraints, and even as a lover of this book, it takes a fair bit of text before you really get absorbed into what's actually taking place. Perhaps, given their [current state of affairs](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/why-netflix-s-most-bullish-analyst-says-the-stock-is-no-longer-a-best-idea/ar-BB1kEf76), it only makes sense to drop us in the deep end of a truly insane world that, _spoiler alert_, only gets crazier, if not incomprehensible.\r\n\r\noverall, worth a watch as there isn't much else going on. it's entertaining. i just wish it were as thought provoking and mind-bending as i remember the books were.\r\n\r\n## slap rating\r\n\r\nthe graphics slapped, even for netflix\r\nthe show get a _love pat_ on the face\r\n\r\n## up next\r\n\r\n[dororo](https://dororo-anime.com/)\r\n";
